# Lung Cancer Prediction Model

# Introduction
I made this project as apart of training machine learning in AI lab in Thamar University. I chose a Dataset that represents information on patients with lung cancer.
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting lung cancer using machine learning models. The models implemented include XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Random Forest.

# Objective
This project aimed to:
•	See the factors that will enhance the model training.
•	evaluated based on accuracy and classification reportss.
•	providing insights into their predictive performance.
•   explore relationships between features

# About the dataset
This dataset contains information on patients with lung cancer, including their age, gender, air pollution exposure, alcohol use, dust allergy, occupational hazards, genetic risk, chronic lung disease, balanced diet, obesity, smoking, passive smoker, chest pain, coughing of blood, fatigue, weight loss ,shortness of breath ,wheezing ,swallowing difficulty ,clubbing of finger nails and snoring.

# Visualizations
The notebook includes data visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to .

# Steps
1.	Importing Libraries
2.	Access to csv file in my drive files
3.	Read the Dataset and check the head
4.	DATA Cleaning
5.	check information
6.	data labeling
7.	find correlation matrix 
8.	splitting the data to training and testing data
9.	training the model.
10.	evaluate the model performance 
11.	improve the performance 
12.	show the accuracy for each training algorithm
13.	The model used
    - XGBoost: Utilizes gradient boosting for classification tasks.
    - AdaBoost: An ensemble method that combines multiple weak classifiers.
    - Random Forest: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees.
      
# Conclusion
This project is an simple application of what I have learned about ML fundamentals (AI fundamental).
For each step within the project implementation, I support the codes with comments and description. 

**I am glad to receive any comments or notes.**
